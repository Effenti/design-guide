# ðŸŒŸ Effenti Design Guide

The goal of this style guide is to uniformize the Effenti brand and keep a consistent image towards our clients. Try to follow the guidelines as much as possible when creating advertising, recruitment posts or anything Effenti-related.


## Logos

Regular logo:
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Black and white:
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Symbol only:
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

On the web, We try to prioritize SVG as much as possible. For those times when this is not possible, please use the following PNGs:

| Size        | Type           | Preview  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| -      | SVG | ![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1") |
| 120x120| PNG |![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1") |
| 300x300| PNG |![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1") |

## Typography

The Effenti corporate font is [Proxima Nova](https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova). Try to use this font as much as possible in advertisements. Although we use the complete font-family, try to favor the following font-weights:

* Thin
* Light
* Regular
* Black

For anything web-related, we use ???
